        Women’s Day first came into existence in 1909 and it was known as National Women’s Day. The day was initially celebrated on 28 February 1909, when 15,000 women marched through New York City
        demanding shorter hours, better pay, and voting rights.Gender inequality and discrimination are rampant in our societies, and most of the time, women are victims of them. To fight these gender
        biases and to bring attention to issues such as gender equality, violence and abuse against women, International Women’s Day is celebrated. It has become a forum to raise awareness and galvanize change in society.</p>
